/**
 * The bridge side of a module: what a module gives the router, and what the
 * router gives a module.
 *
 * Core never imports a module. The router reaches modules only through this
 * interface, and the list of installed modules comes from src/modules/index.ts
 * (the one wiring point). A module may import core freely.
 *
 * The router keeps the parts every tool shares: profile routing, the session
 * pin of profile + tab, leases, strict mode, auto-file, the context-block
 * stamp. A module plugs into five places:
 *
 *   tools / instructions  listed and announced only while the module is on
 *   aliases               old tool names kept working, routed to the tool
 *                         each now names (listed only while the module is on)
 *   prepare               file params in before the extension call, the
 *                         write-out after it (recipe out_file, LCAP content_path)
 *   handle                tools answered in the bridge (pure helpers and
 *                         orchestrators that drive several extension calls)
 *   session               extra pin fields on top of profile + tab (Workato's
 *                         workspace and environment)
